# Pipelines

Pipelines is a system where virtually all behavior is customizable.  All interactions are defined by pipelines.

Each pipeline has one or more wells (sources), zero or more pipes, and one or more faucets (sinks).  Data should travel through the pipeline in a linear fashion.  It can be thought of as analogous to unix's standard shell pipelines, but more powerful thanks to its capability to pass along arbitrary data types.

An example pipeline definition file:

```
well: file(/input.txt)
pipe: processor.lua
pipe: subsequent.lua
faucet: file(/output.txt)
```

Pipelines is intentionally low-overhead.
